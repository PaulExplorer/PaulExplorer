# Hi, I'm PLLX76 👋

### Self-taught developer & high school student in France

I started programming at age 12 during the COVID-19 lockdown, driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. Since then, I've explored many languages, built games, sites, and tools, and contributed to open source.

## 🚀 My Coding Journey

- **12 years old:**  
  Began with a simple website and some Python scripts, learning by copying code and experimenting.

- **13 years old:**  
  Discovered Java and created my first game — a Star Wars-themed spaceship dodging meteors, all from scratch.

- **14 years old:**  
  Learned C++ and built my first large project: [CubeGame2D](https://github.com/PLLX76/CubeGame2D), a parkour-style escape game.  
  Also wrote many Discord bots in Python.

- **15 years old:**  
  Continued with C++, experimented with Flutter, and built a C# music app. Developed several websites with Python backends.

- **16 years old:**  
  Released [OeuvresTrack](https://github.com/PLLX76/OeuvresTrack), a web app to track movies, series, and books, get notifications for new releases, and more.

- **17 years old:**  
  Picked up Rust and enjoyed building games with Bevy and SDL2.  
  Created [FamilyNest](https://github.com/PLLX76/FamilyNest), a collaborative genealogy application in Rust with powerful cloud features and advanced rendering.  
  Contributed to my first open-source project: [my-internet](https://github.com/sameerasw/my-internet).  
  Currently developing a new genealogy web app using Rust & WASM, focusing on better rendering, accessibility, and multi-user collaboration.
